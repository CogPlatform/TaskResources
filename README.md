# Task Resources

Behavioural task resources for CageLab or other projects. 

1. Backgrounds — textures and images for task backgrounds to give consistent context for a particular task, CC licensed or public domain images from unsplash. For marble textures a large 8K texture was subsampled to multiple 1920x1080 images with local differences but retaining global similarity.
2. Fractals — See [Python code `fractals.py`](https://github.com/CogPlatform/TaskResources/blob/main/generate/fractals.py) that generates these 2D parametric textures. They are loosely based on this paper (my attempt to get the algorithm working though they look a bit different): Miyashita, Y., Higuchi, S.-I., Sakai, K., & Masui, N. (1991). Generation of fractal patterns for probing the visual memory. Neuroscience Research, 12(1), 307–311. https://doi.org/10.1016/0168-0102(91)90121-e 
3. Quaddles — quaddle 2.0 parametric objects for use in tasks. See https://github.com/xwen1765/blender-quaddle for the details.
4. Flowers — flower images for use in tasks, CC licensed or public domain.
